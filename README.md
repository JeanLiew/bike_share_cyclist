# Share Bike - Cyclist Case Study

## About the company
In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime.
Until now, Cyclistic’s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. One approach that helped make these things possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.
Cyclistic’s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. Although the pricing flexibility helps Cyclistic attract more customers, Cyclistic believes that maximizing the number of annual members will be key to future growth. 


## Goal
Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. In order to do that, however, the marketing analyst team needs to better understand how annual members and casual riders differ, why casual riders would buy a membership, and how digital media could affect their marketing tactics.

## Insights

Difference between casual riders and members are driven by the following 

1. Purpose
2. Duration 

Members are subscribed to us with intention to use the service for commuting purpose, unlike casual rider who rides during weekends and at a longer duration, for leisure. 


The travelling distance shows that most casual riders are using the service in between 30 to 40 minutes per session whereas members ride between 16 - 20 regardless of the time of the day. This is twice as much time spent compared to members. 

The timeline of the usage of the service revolves are also different for both as casual riders ride msotly in the day, unlike members that has a fair distribution of usage through out the day.
